# beuhealth-app (Next.js + Ionic starter)

This is a runnable scaffold for the BeuHealth mobile app (Next.js 15 + React 19 + Ionic).

## Quick start

1. Unzip the project
2. `cd beuhealth-app`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:3000

Place your `disease.json` and `disease_eng.json` files into `public/data/` (they are created as empty files for you to paste into). The API route `/api/diseases` reads those files and serves them to the app.
